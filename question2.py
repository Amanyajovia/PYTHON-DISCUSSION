  # Question 2(i)

# Define a function named calculate_bmi that takes a person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in 
# meters) as parameters and returns their BMI. (BMI = weight/height) 
# Calculate and send their BMI category: 
# Below 18.5: "Under weight" 
# 18.5 to 24.9: "Normal weight" 
# 25 to 29.9: "Ove rweight" 
# 30 or above: "Obese" 
# Weight = int(input("Enter the weight of a person in kilograms: "))
# Height = float(input("Enter the height of the person in meters: "))
# BMI =Weight/Height
# if BMI  < 18.5:
#     print("Under weight")

# elif 18.5 <=BMI <=24.9:
#     print("Normal weight")

# elif 25 <= BMI <= 29.9:
#     print("Over weight")

# else:
#     print("Obese")




# Question 2(ii)
# Use a function to calculate the volume of a cylinder V = Ï€ r2 h. Choose a function name in line with what you want to 
# achieve. Radius r and height h should be in parameters. Make sure you use the real pie value (import math)

r = 5  
h = 10 
import math
pie = math.pi
volume_of_a_cylinder = pie*r**2*h
print(f"The volume of the cylinder with radius {r} and height {h} is {volume_of_a_cylinder:.2f}")
